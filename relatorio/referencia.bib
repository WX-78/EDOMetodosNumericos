	abstract = {This report gives a basically new approach to the formulation of the classic Runge-Kutta process. 
	Dependence on the tedious Taylor expansions is ob- viated by a matrix equation which defines the Runge- Kutta 
	equations for any order; furthermore, the ele- ments of these matrices are obtained quite simply. The method of 
	quadratures is used to determine the conditions on the parameters which characterize the process since these parameters 
	determine the order of accuracy of these functions.},
